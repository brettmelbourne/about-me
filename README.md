# about-me
Hi I'm Brett, professor of ecological modeling and data science. I don't put much here on my personal GitHub site. You'll mostly find forked repositories and sandboxes. Head over to [melbourne-lab](https://github.com/melbourne-lab), where you'll find contributions from me, my students and postdocs out of our lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. We have repositories for both research and teaching in modeling and data science for ecology.
